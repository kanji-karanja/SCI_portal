# Maseno Univeristy School Of Computing Portal
**Firstly, I believe all code should be open source**
</br>
### Background:
The school of computing and informatics is the heart of All Information Technology units for all courses, well almost all, dubbed all courses as "With IT" except courses whose main home is the School itself.</br>
The need for a separate yet distinct portal has arisen to ease how students get information and when.

### The portal
The portal acts as an interface between the students and the administration easing up work and wastage of time as well as crowding of the main University portal.

### Objectives
1. Fully functional website(portal) where students can receive information and news as well as updates about things occuring in the school.
2. A fully functional noticeboard.
3. A chat room for raising issues.
4. Capabilities of changing user settings

### Languages used/Platforms used
1. PHP
2. Foundation
3. HTML
4. CSS
5. JS

### Notes:
1. This is a work in progress.
2. Any code used here is not liable to misuse and hacking of the site.
3. Anyone interested can assist in the design of the portal.
